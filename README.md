# Maze
This is just a regular rectangular maze, which implemented in console and looks splendid
It's fully auto-generated maze, and every time it has different shape, because it uses, to my mind, the best
maze-creating algorithm, based on randomizing the path through every corner, while there`s no one left uncovered.
You`ll see how the path of this maze is creating, making it more and more complex. IF you want to change size - you
could change it in macros, by changing the numbers in corresponding margin.

You're free to do with this program whatever you want, even embedding it into your project!
