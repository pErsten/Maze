# Maze
This is just a regular rectangular maze, which implemented in console and looks like that:

▒▒    ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒

It's fully auto-generated maze, and every time it has different shape, because it uses, to my mind, the best
maze-creating algorithm, based on randomizing the path through every corner, while there`s no one left uncovered.
Also you can change the size of it by typing quantity of rows and columns, after that you'll see the randomly
generated maze.
You're free to do with this program whatever you want, even embedding it into your project!
